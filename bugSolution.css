The main issue lies in the order of operations and how different browsers interpret the `calc()` function, particularly when dealing with percentages and fixed units. To solve this, carefully review the calculations. Avoid overly complex nested expressions.  Consider using explicit pixel values or other fixed units where possible to simplify calculations and increase cross-browser compatibility. In some cases, using Javascript to dynamically calculate and apply the width can provide a more reliable solution.

Here is an example of correcting the `width: calc(50% - 10px);` issue if the goal is that the element is half of the container width minus 10px:

```css
/* bug.css */
.container {
  width: 500px; /* Example width */
}

.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
  background-color: lightblue; /* For demonstration */
}

/* bugSolution.css */
.container {
  width: 500px; /* Example width */
}

.element {
  width: calc(250px - 10px); /* Explicit Calculation */
  background-color: lightgreen; /* For demonstration */
}
```
By pre-calculating the pixel value, you eliminate the browser's interpretation of percentages within `calc()`.
